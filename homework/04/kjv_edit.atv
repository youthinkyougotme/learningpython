Ge@1@1@In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
Ge@1@2@And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
Ge@1@3@And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
Ge@1@4@And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
