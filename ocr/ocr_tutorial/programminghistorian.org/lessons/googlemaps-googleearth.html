<p>Google My Maps and Google Earth provide an easy way to start creating
digital maps. With a Google Account you can create and edit personal
maps by clicking on My Places.</p>

<p>In My Maps you can choose between several different base maps
(including the standard satellite, terrain, or standard maps) and add
points, lines and polygons. It is also possible to import data from a
spreadsheet, if you have columns with geographical information (i.e.
longitudes and latitudes or place names). This automates a formerly
complex task known as geocoding. Not only is this one of the easiest
ways to begin plotting your historical data on a map, but it also has
the power of Google’s search engine. As you read about unfamiliar places
in historical documents, journal articles or books, you can search for
them using Google Maps. It is then possible to mark numerous locations
and explore how they relate to each other geographically. Your personal
maps are saved by Google (in their cloud), meaning you can access them
from any computer with an internet connection. You can keep them private
or embed them in your website or blog. Finally, you can export your
points, lines, and polygons as KML files and open them in Google Earth
or Quantum GIS.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Open your favorite browser</li>
  <li>Go to Google’s My  <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com">Maps Engine Lite</a>:

  <li>Log in to your Google Account if you aren’t already logged in
(follow the basic instructions to create an account if necessary)</li>

  <li>Next, you can use the search bar.
Try searching the location of your current research project. You can
then click on the location and add it to your map by clicking ‘add
to map’. This is the simplest method of adding points to your new
map. Try searching for some historical place names that no longer
exist (Ontario’s Berlin or Constantinople). You will find mixed
results, where Google often identifies the correct location, but
also offers up incorrect alternatives. This is important to keep in
mind when creating spreadsheet, as it is normally better to use the
modern place names and avoid risking that Google with choose the
wrong Constantinople.</li>

<h3 id="creating-vector-layers">Creating Vector Layers</h3>

<p>You can also create new map layers (known more formally
as vector layers). Vector layers are one of the main components of
digital mapping (including GIS). They are simply points, lines, or
polygons used to represent geographic features. Points can be used to
identify and label key locations, lines are often used for streets or
railroads, and polygons allow you to represent area (fields, buildings,
city wards, etc). They work the same in Google Maps as they do in GIS.
The big limitation is that you can only add limited information into the
database tables associated with the points, lines, or polygons. This is
a problem as you scale up your digital mapping research, but it is not a
problem when you are starting out. In Google Maps you can add a label, a
text description, and links to a website or photo. More information
about creating historical vectors in a full GIS is available in
<a href="vector-layers-qgis.html">Creating New Vector Layers in QGIS 2.0</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To add a layer, you can either click on the layer that has been
created for you in the menu box, with the name ‘Untitled Layer’.
Click on ‘Untitled Layer’ and rename it ‘Layer 1′. Or you can create
another layer: click on the ‘Add layer’ button. This will add a new
‘Untitled Layer’ which you can name as ‘Layer 2′. It should look
like this:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Note that to the right of Layer there is a checkbox – unchecking
this box turns off (i.e. it doesn’t appear on the map) a layer and
its information. Uncheck the UK Global Fats layer and click on Layer
1.</li>
  <li>Before adding vector layers we should consider which base map to
use. At the bottom of the menu window, there is a line that says
‘base map’. A base map is a map** depicting background reference
information such as roads, borders, landforms, etc. on top of which
layers containing different types of spatial information can be
placed. Google’s Maps  allows you to choose from a variety of
base maps, depending on the kind of map you want to create.
Satellite imagery is becoming a standard form of base map, but it is
information-rich and may detract from the other map features you are
trying to highlight. Some simple alternatives include ‘light
landmass’, or even ‘light political’ if you require political
boundaries.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the arrow to the right of ‘Base map’ in the window; a
submenu appears allowing you to choose different types of base maps.
Choose ‘Satellite’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Start by adding some Placemarks (the Google equivalent of a point).
Click on the add Markers button underneath the search bar near the
top of the window. Click on the spot on the map where you want the
Placemark to appear.</li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will notice that your Placemark now appears under Layer 1 on the
left of the screen in your menu window. There is a place to change
icon shape and icon colour if you click on the symbol just to the
right of the Placemark name. Also, directly under the title Layer 1
there are menus titled Style, Data, and Labels. The Style menu
controls different aspects of the Layer’s appearance, while Data
shows you the data you added in the description box for your
Placemark. Labels menu allows you to control whether the name or
description of your Placemark appears besides it on the actual map.</p>

  <li>Now we will add some lines and shapes (called polygons in GIS
software). Adding lines and polygons is a very similar process. We
will draw some lines in a new layer (different types of points,
lines, and shapes should be in separate layers).</li>
  <li>Select Layer 2 in your menu box (you will know which layer you have
selected because of the blue outline on the left of the box).</li>
  <li>Click the ‘add line or shape’ icon box directly to the right of the

to create an enclosed formation. To do this, start drawing and
finish by clicking on the first point in your line. You can create
simple shapes, such as a farmer’s field, or much more complex
shapes, such as the outline of a city (see examples below). Feel
free to experiment with creating lines and polygons.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Like placemarks and lines, you can change the name and description
of a polygon. You can also change the colour and line width by
clicking on the icon to the right of your polygon name in the menu
box. Here you can also change the transparency, which is discussed
immediately below.</li>
  <li>Note that the area bounded (i.e. inside) a polygon is shaded the
same colour as the polygon outline. You can change the opaqueness of
this shading by changing the ‘transparency’ which alters the extent
to which you can clearly see the background image (your base map).</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="share-your-custom-map">Share your custom map</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The best way to share the map online is by using the <strong>Share</strong>
button in the menu. This provides a link which can be
share in an email or through social media like G+, Facebook, or
Twitter.</li>
  <li>Another way to share a dynamic version of your map is to embed it in
a blog or website using the “embed on my website” option dropdown menu to the right of the save button. Selecting this option provides an inline frame or
&lt;iframe&gt; tag that you can then insert into an HTML site. You can
modify the height and width of the frame by changing the numbers in
quotation marks.</li>
  <li>Note: there is currently no way to set the
default scale or legend options of the embedded map, but if you need
to eliminate the legend from the map that appears on your HTML site
you can do so by reducing the width if the &lt;iframe&gt; to 580 or
less.</li>
  <li>You can also export the data as a KML file using the same dropdown menu. It will give you the
option to export the whole map or to select one layer in particular.
Try exporting the UK Global Fats layer as a KML layer. You’ll be
able to import this data into other programs, including Google Earth
and Quantum GIS. This is an important feature, as it means you can
start working with digital maps using Google Map and still export
your work into a GIS database in the future.</li>
  <li>You can stop the lesson here if you think this free Google Map
service provides all the tools you need for your research topic. Or
you can keep going and learn about Google Earth and in lesson 2,
Quantum GIS.</li>

historical maps. Google Maps doesn’t require you to install software and
your maps are saved in the cloud. Google Earth requires software
installation and is not cloud-based, though maps you create can be
exported.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install Google Earth: <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html">http://www.google.com/earth/index.html</a></li>
  <li>Open the program and familiarize yourself with the digital globe.
Use the menu to add and remove layers of information. This is very
similar to how more advanced GIS programs work. You can add and
remove different kinds of geographical information including
Political Boundaries (polygons), Roads (lines), and Places (points).
See the red arrows in the following image for the location of these
layers.</li>

  <li>Google Earth also contains some scanned historical maps and aerial
photographs (in GIS these types of maps, which are made up of
pixels, are known as raster data). Under Gallery you can find and
click Rumsey Historical Maps. This will add icons all over the globe
(with a concentration in the United States) of scanned maps that
have been georeferenced (stretched and pinned to match a location)
onto the digital globe. This previews a key methodology in
historical GIS. (You can also find historical map layers and other
HGIS layers in the Earth Gallery). Take some time to explore a
number of historical maps. See if there are any maps included in the
Rumsey Collection that might be useful for your research or
teaching. (You can find many more digitized, but not georeferenced
maps at <a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/">www.davidrumsey.com</a>.)</li>

<h2 id="kml-keyhole-markup-language-files">KML: Keyhole Markup Language files</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Google developed a file format to save and share map data: KML. This
stands for Keyhole Markup Language, and it is a highly portable type
of file (i.e. a KML can be used with different types of GIS
software) that can store many different types of GIS data, including
vector data.</li>
  <li>Maps and images you create in Google Maps and Google Earth can be
saved as KML files This means you can save work done in Google Maps
or Google Earth. With KML files you can transfer data between these
two platforms and bring your map data into Quantum GIS or ArcGIS.</li>
  <li>For example, you can import the data you created in Google Maps
Engine Lite. If you created a map in the exercise above, it can be
found by clicking “Open Map” on the <a href="https://mapsengine.google.com/map/">Maps Engine Lite</a> home page.
Click on the folder icon on the left hand side of the legend beneath
the map title and click “export to KML”. (You can also download and
explore Dan Macfarlane’s <a href="https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/files/148993/seaway.zip">Seaway map</a> for this part of the
exercise).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bringing your KML file into Google Earth</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the KML file from Google Maps Engine Lite (as described
above).</li>
  <li>Double click on the KML file in your Download folder.</li>
  <li>Find the data in the Temporary Folder in Google Earth.</li>

  <li>You can now explore these map features in 3D, or you can add new
lines, points and polygons using the various icons along the top
left of your Google Earth window (see image below). This works in
essentially the same way as it did for Google Maps, although there
is more functionality and options. In Dan’s Seaway map, the old
canals and current Seaway route were traced in different line
colours and widths using the line feature (this was made possible by
overlaying historical maps, which is described below), while various
features were marked off with appropriate Placemarks. For those so
inclined, there is also the option of recording a tour that could be
useful for presentations or teaching purposes (when the “record a
tour” icon is selected, recording options will show up on the bottom
left of the window).</li>

<h2 id="adding-scanned-historical-maps">Adding Scanned Historical Maps</h2>

<p>Within Google Earth, you can upload a digital copy of a historical map.
This could be a map that has been scanned, or an image obtained that is
already in a digital format (for tips on finding historical maps online
see: <a href="http://niche-canada.org/2011/12/14/mobile-mapping-and-historical-gis-in-the-field/" title="Mobile Mapping and Historical GIS in the Field">Mobile Mapping and Historical GIS in the Field</a>). The main
purpose for uploading a digital map, from a historical perspective, is
to place it over top of a Google Earth image in the browser. This is
known as an overlay. Performing an overlay allows for useful comparisons
of change over time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start by identifying the images you want to use: the image within
Google Earth, and the map you want to overlay with. For the map you
want to overlay, the file can be in JPEG or TIFF format, but not
PDF.</li>
  <li>Within Google Earth, identify the area of the map you want to
overlay. Note that you can go back in time (i.e. look at older
satellite photos) by clicking on the ‘Show historical imagery’ icon
on the top toolbar. and then adjusting the time-scale slider that
will appear.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>To the right of the Link field, click the Browse button to select
from your files the map you wish to be the overlaying image.</li>
  <li>Move the New Image Overlay window out of the way (don’t close it or
click “Cancel” or “OK”) so that you can see the Google Earth
browser. The map you uploaded will now appear over top of the Google
Earth satellite image in the Google Earth browser.</li>
  <li>There are fluorescent green markers in the middle and at the edges
of the uploaded map. These can be used to stretch, shrink, and move
the map so that it aligns properly with the satellite image. This is
a simple form of georeferencing (see <a href="georeferencing-qgis.html">Georeferencing in QGIS 2.0</a>).
The image below shows the above steps using an old map of the town
of Aultsville overlaid on top of Google satellite imagery from 2008
in which the remains of the town’s roads and building foundations in
the St. Lawrence River are visible (Aultsville was one of the Lost
Villages flooded out by the St. Lawrence Seaway and Power
Project).</li>

  <li>Back in the New Image Overlay window, note that there are a range of
options (Description, View, Altitude, Refresh, Location) that you
can select. At this point, you likely don’t need to worry about
these, although you may wish to add information under the
Description tab.</li>
  <li>Once you are satisfied with your overlay, in the New Image Overlay
window click on OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
  <li>You will want to save your work. Under File on your computer’s menu
bar, you have two options. You can save a copy of the image (File
-&gt; Save -&gt; Save Image…) you have created to your computer in jpg
format, and you can also save the overlay within Google Earth so
that it can be accessed in the future (File -&gt; Save -&gt; Save My
Places). The latter is saved as a KML file.</li>
  <li>To share KML files simply locate the file you saved to your computer
and upload it to your website, social media site, or send it as an
email attachment.</li>
